**Airbnb Booking analysis**

**Problem statement:**
Airbnb is an online marketplace for short-term homestays and experiences.Founded in 2008,it acts as a broker and charges a commission from each booking.Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name AirBedandBreakfast.com.It is available in 65000 cities and over 191 countries around the world.In 2021,Airbnb generated $5.9 billion revenue.Airbnb has 150 million users.
There are over seven million listings on Airbnb,run by four million hosts.

This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix between categorical and numeric values.

Explore and analyze the data to discover key understandings (not limited to these) such as :

**1**.What can we learn about different hosts and areas?

**2**.What can we learn from predictions?

**2.1** Type of room

**2.2** locations,

**2.3** prices,

**2.4** reviews

**3**.Which hosts are the busiest and why?

**4**.Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?

**5**.What is the percentage of listings owned by Airbnb in different neighbourhoods?

**Data summary:**

The given dataset has 48,895 observations and 16 different features. Let us look what each feature is all about

**id** id given to listings

**name** name of the listing

**host_id** unique host ids

**host_name** Gives host name

**neighbourhood_group** It contains 5 neighbourhood groups namely : Brooklyn,Manhattan,Queens,Staten island,Bronx.

**neighbourhood** There are total of 221 different neighbourhoods.

**latitude** It gives the latitude of house listing.It helps in getting the location.

**longitude** It gives the longitude of the house listing.It helps in getting the location.

**room_type** There are total of 3 different types of rooms available on Airbnb.i,e.,Private room,Entire home or apartment and shared room.

**calculated_host_listings** It tells about the number of times a host was listed or booked by people

**availability_365** It tells about availability of listing out of 365 days


**Steps in Exploratory Data Analysis**
1. Descriptive analysis

What is it? Synthesis of the information provided by the dataset,extracting its most representative characteristics.

Why is it necessary? To understand the types of data,discover patterns and prepare the data for future analysis.

2. Adjustment of Variable types

What is it? Verify that the variables have been stored with the appropriate corresponding value type.

Why is it necessary? Bad coding of variables can negatively influence the grouping of data or the results of the analysis.

3. Detection and treating of Missing Data

What is it? Identify some of the missing data in the variable.

Why is it necessary? Missing data can create probelms when applying machine learning techniques,building predictive models,performing statistical analysis or generating graphical representations.

4. Detection and treatment of atypical Data

What is it?To identify data with values significantly different from those of the variable.

Why is it necessary? They can modify the results and reduce the power of the statistical analyis or machine learning techniques applied.

5. Correlation of variables

What is it? Analysing the relationship between two or more variables.

Why is it necessary? Among the other reasons,to discard possible variables that provide redundant information in the dataset,causing noise in the analysis.
